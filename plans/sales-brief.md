  Sales Brief

  AlphaBase — Your Trading Knowledge, Instantly Searchable

  The Problem
  Traders and investors consume hundreds of hours of YouTube education — strategy breakdowns, market analysis, stock picks, macro
  commentary. But when they need to recall a specific insight, they're stuck scrubbing through videos or relying on memory. Knowledge
   is scattered, unsearchable, and lost.

  The Solution
  AlphaBase turns YouTube trading channels into a personal AI-powered knowledge base. Point it at a channel, select the videos that
  matter, and AlphaBase transcribes, indexes, and makes everything instantly queryable through a conversational AI assistant.

  How It Works
  1. Import — Paste a YouTube channel URL. AlphaBase auto-categorizes videos (educational, stock picks, market news, macro
  commentary) so you pick what matters.
  2. Index — Selected videos are transcribed and embedded into a semantic search engine. Your knowledge base grows with every import.
  3. Chat — Ask questions in natural language. The AI retrieves relevant transcript passages and delivers grounded answers with
  source citations.

  Who It's For
  - Retail traders building a personal education library
  - Trading communities that want a shared knowledge hub from their favorite educators
  - Financial content creators who want to offer AI-powered Q&A on their own content

  Key Differentiators
  - Answers are grounded in actual video content, not generic LLM knowledge — with source links
  - Automatic video categorization saves hours of manual curation
  - Real-time streaming responses with full conversation history
  - Works with any YouTube channel, not just one creator

  Example Use Case
  "What has ZipTrader said about NVDA in the last 6 months?" → AlphaBase retrieves the relevant transcript segments across multiple
  videos and synthesizes a sourced answer in seconds.
